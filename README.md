## Abstract

1. Written in Next.ts
2. Struggled with Redux Provider(Actually implied w/ HOC, Next won't let you use react-redux)
3. Convenience of Redux-toolkit and Thunk(Long live the Thunk!)

## Specifics

1. Next.js
2. TypeScript
3. Redux-Toolkit

## Why not Saga?

1. I loved that library so much (generator grammar, take~ methods etc.)
2. But think about Redux-saga's last update(Sep., 2019)
3. RTK(Redux-toolkit) is based on Redux-thunk
4. Way much shorter than Redux + Redux-saga combination's code
